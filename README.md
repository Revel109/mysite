HTML5:

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current
version of the HTML standard.
It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to improve the language with support for the latest
multimedia, while keeping it both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web 
browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes 
the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web 
applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes
features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

CSS3:

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, 
the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, 
or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually 
engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as 
the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in 
the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
